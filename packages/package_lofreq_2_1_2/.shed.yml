    LoFreq* (i.e. LoFreq version 2) is a fast and sensitive variant-caller for inferring SNVs 
    and indels from next-generation sequencing data. It makes full use of base-call qualities and 
    other sources of errors inherent in sequencing (e.g. mapping or base/indel alignment uncertainty), 
    which are usually ignored by other methods or only used for filtering.

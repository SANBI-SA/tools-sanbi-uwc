# Galaxy Tools maintained by the SANBI-UWC Galaxy Team

The repo's main goals are to:
  * simplify and centralise the maintenance of the SANBI-UWC related tools
  * provide a learning environment to Galaxy Tool developers 

Wrapping tools for use in Galaxy is easy! If you want to start, please see [our wiki](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Admin/Tools/AddToolTutorial).
